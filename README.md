# 💖 Welcome sweet people, how are you? I hope you’re doing well :)

🌧️ I'm Yağmur, let me tell you a little bit about myself:

📌 Currently learning **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** 🧗‍♀️  
📌 Interested in **Frontend Development** 🪄🖼️  

📌 I’ll be sharing my projects here with you 📥📮

but don’t worry, we always manage to make peace 😆
